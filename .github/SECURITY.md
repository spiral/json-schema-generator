Security Policy
===============

If you found something which shouldn't be there or a bug which opens a security 
hole, please let me know immediately by email `wolfy-j[at]spiralscout.com`.

DO NOT PUBLISH SECURITY REPORTS PUBLICLY.

The full [Security Policy][1] is described in the official documentation.
